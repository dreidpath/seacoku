# My SEACO
SEACO is a health and demographic surveillance site in Malaysia (http://www.seaco.asia).

We collect health and social data on about 38,000 people.  One of the challenges is to make the data available in a way that it can be analysed an understood by the local community who contribute to that.

seacoku is an R, shiny app for the exploration of SEACO data by the community.  The data themselves are not available on github, but the code is available.

The mulilingual aspects imported into this App were developed by Christophe Ladroue. Ladroue's code is available here: https://github.com/chrislad/multilingualShinyApp.
